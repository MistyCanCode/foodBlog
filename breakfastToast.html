									<h1>i tried that<br />
									Fancy Breakfast Toast</h1>
									<p>What started as a breakfast staple<br/>turned into one of the best gourmet meals i've ever experienced</p>

								<p>I have never been one for open faced sandwhiches of any kind. Like, why eat only a half sandwhich when you can eat the whole thing? So when I was out with some friends for brunch one morn-- ok let's be honest here -- one afternoon, I didn't understand why they ordered the fancy breakfast toast.</p>
								<p>At that moment, I decided that was going to be my next culinary adventure. So, I headed down to my local Publix to gather some ingredients.<br/>One loaf of crusty sourdough (yes please), one avocado, some smoked salmon, hardboiled eggs(don't judge me), a red onion, and one package of goat cheese.</p>
                                <p>How it started: <br/> I didn't have a recipe, so I just kind of threw some things together for this, which I would suggest you do the same, it worked very well. I just used stuff I already knew I liked.</p>
                                <p>How it went: <br/>So, I sliced the sourdough and lightly toasted one side under the broiler and then <em>heavily</em> toasted the other side. I pulled that out of the oven and put it aside, next I mashed some avocado and added one hardboiled egg to that mix. Meanwhile I had sliced the red onion and coated it in some vinegar - balsamic to be exact. Then I layered the avocado/egg mixture with some smoked salmon and the vinegared red onion and then crumbled the goat cheese on top. I put that back under the broiler for just a few minutes and then added a freshly fried over easy egg on top.</p>
                                <p>How it turned out: <br/>So naturally I really wanted another piece of bread to fill out my new food experiment, but I was able to use the smidge of willpower that I had left in me and didn't. I put it on a plate, sat down, and then wasn't really sure what to do. Do I pick it up? Do I need a knife and fork? Fold it in half? IDK, so I just picked it up and took a big bite. <br/>AMAZEBALLS<br/>Honestly, I would still totes make a sammie out of this but it was so good y'all. I would do it every weekend, messy fingers, face and all. Please try this! And let me know what you think. Give me some more open faced sammich ideas you guys, I'll report back, swear!</p>
