									<p>Ok, so this isn't your typical Cinco de Mayo food post. But it very well might be the best one ever.</p>

								<p>It was May 4th at my local Publix, when I was purchasing all my groceries to make tacos for friends for international margharita day, when I thought to myself, "self, what do you want with your tacos tomorrow?" And since I'm all about the carbs but at the same time, I am trying to not eat as many, {tear}, I thought this would be a great opportunity to grill some corn!</p>
								<p>So, I did what I normally do in times like these and pulled out my phone to do some Googling. Much to my surprise, it looked fairly easy. All I needed was some chili powder, some crumbly white cheese, limes, and...mayo?<br/>WHAAAAAT?</p>
                                <p>I want to be the first to admit how wrong I was. I mixed everything up, smeared it on some corn and wrapped it in some aluminum foil and put them on the grill. When they were done, I squeezed some lime juice on them, another healthy dash of chili powder, and lightly dusted some of the crumbly cheese on top</p>
                                <p><em>Boy Howdy</em>these things were a hit. Not only were all the margharitas gone at the end of the night, all the corn was too. It turned out to be the hit of the night. The creamy-ness mixed with the crunch of the corn and the spice. And the lime juice. Well you can only guess how well that went with the drinks. Plus, I put them on sticks, so they were so easy to walk around with. I am telling you right now, you must try these. They aren't only for food truck vendors anymore.</p>
                                <p>What do you think? Do you like street corn as much as I do? Did I leave out a secret ingredient that would take them to the next level? And what else do I need to throw on the grill? Because believe me, I'll try that!</p>
