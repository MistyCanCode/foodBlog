								<p>I had a mushroom growing kit gifted to me recently, so guess what? I grew and ate my own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Blue-Oyster-Mushroom-Growing/dp/B00N190V6K/ref=asc_df_B00N190V6K?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=79852084455111&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583451663041804&psc=1">blue oysters</a>.</p>
                                <p>This was a fun little project. So, these specific kits come with everything you need to grow blue oysters. All you really have to do is cut the plastic packaging like the instructions say, and place the package in a clean bowl with about a half an inch of water. I set this on my desk and just left it alone. Kind of like those chia pets from the 90's. Off did I just show my age? Sorry about that. Gen-X problems I guess.</p>
                                <p>In a little over three weeks, I had little mushroom babies coming out of the container! They were so pretty, mostly white with light blue caps that got a smidge darker as they grew. Keep in mind, they were inside another bag to keep the humidity in, so you couldn't see them very clearly unless you opened the bag.</p>
                                <p>I wasn't quite sure when they were ready specifically, but when they looked mature-ish, I popped those suckers right off the block, gave them a quick wipe down with a paper towel, and put them in a 9 inch round skillet with some clarified butter and some salt, pepper, and minced garlic. I stirred them around for a bit, added a few cherry tomatoes and some fresh spinach, and tossed all of that with some authentic ramen, that I convienently ordered from Amazon. And had one heck of a dinner. Y'all, I didn't even have to share, because the husband doesn't like mushrooms. Man did he miss out. 10/10 would recommend this if you are interested. I'm thinking about trying lions mane next, I hear those are super good for you.</p>
                                <p>Have you ever grown your own mushrooms? What did you think? Is there another kind I should try? Let me know, and I may just try that.</p>
